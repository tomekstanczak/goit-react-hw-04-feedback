Feedback Collection and Analysis App (Course Assignment - React Hooks Edition)

This project represents an evolution of my React skills, showcasing an updated version of a feedback collection and analysis app. Originally developed as part of a coding course assignment, I revisited and refactored the code, transitioning from class-based components to functional components with React Hooks.

Key Features:

    Interactive Feedback: Users can provide feedback through selectable options ('good', 'neutral', 'bad').
    Dynamic Statistics: Real-time updates display the count of each feedback type and the overall feedback percentage.
    Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be adaptive for a seamless experience across various devices.

Changes and Enhancements:

    React Hooks: Transitioned from class-based components to functional components, utilizing state and effects with React Hooks.
    Simplified State Management: Utilized the useState hook for a cleaner and more concise state management approach.
    Side Effects with useEffect: Employed the useEffect hook for handling side effects, specifically for updating total feedback and positive feedback percentage.
    Conditional Rendering: Improved code readability by simplifying conditional rendering in the handleIncrement function.

Technologies Used:

    React: Showcasing proficiency in both class-based and functional component approaches.
    React Hooks: Demonstrating the ability to use modern React Hooks for state management and side effects.
    PropTypes: Ensuring proper type checking for props to maintain data integrity.
    GitHub Version Control: The project continues to be hosted on GitHub, highlighting version control skills acquired in the course.

Learning Goals:

    Understanding Hooks: Gain proficiency in using React Hooks for state management and side effects.
    Code Refactoring: Practice refactoring code to improve readability and maintainability.
    Continual Improvement: Open to feedback and suggestions to further enhance coding skills and project functionality.

Feel free to explore the updated code, provide feedback, or use it as a reference. I welcome any insights or recommendations to improve both the project and my learning experience.
